Linux OR Unix Interview Questions 
1)  What is GRUB

Ans GNU GRUB is a Multiboot boot loader. It was derived from GRUB, the GRand Unified Bootloader, 
which was originally designed and implemented by Erich Stefan Boleyn.

Briefly, a boot loader is the first software program that runs when a computer starts. It is 
responsible for loading and transferring control to the operating system kernel software 
(such as the Hurd or Linux). The kernel, in turn, initializes the rest of the operating 
system (e.g. GNU)

2) Explain Linux Boot Process

Ans http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/02/linux-boot-process/

3) Which files are called for user profile by default when a user gets login

Ans $HOME/.bash_profile, $HOME/.bash_bashrc

4) Which file needs to update if srequired to change default runlevel 5 to 3

Ans File is /etc/inittab and required to change below lines:

id:5:initdefault: to id:3:initdefault:

5) What command used for showing user info like Login Name, Canonical Name, Home Directory,Shell etc..

Ans FINGER command can be used i.g; finger username

6) What is inode number

Ans An inode is a data structure on a traditional Unix-style file system such as UFS or ext3. An 
inode stores basic information about a regular file, directory, or other file system object

iNode number also called as index number, it consists following attributes:

File type (executable, block special etc)
Permissions (read, write etc)
Owner
Group
File Size
File access, change and modification time (remember UNIX or Linux never stores file creation 
time, this is favorite question asked in UNIX/Linux sys admin job interview)
File deletion time
Number of links (soft/hard)
Extended attribute such as append only or no one can delete file including root user 
(immutability)
Access Control List (ACLs)

Following command will be used to show inodes of file and folders:

ls -i

Following command will show complete info about any file or folders with inode number

stat file/folder

Files/Folders can also be deleted using inode numbers with following command:

find out the inode number using 'ls -il' command then run below command

find . -inum inode_number -exec rm -i {} \;

2) If original file deleted then soft link file be of no use
3) Soft links are not updated
4) Can create links between directories
5) Can cross file system boundaries

Hard Links => 1) Hard links will have the same inode number as source file

truncate original file :)

27) Command to collect detailed information about the hardware and setup of your system

Ans dmidecode , sysreport

28) Command to check PCI devices vendor or version

Ans lspci

29) What is the difference between cron and anacron

Ans  Cron :
                     1) Minimum granularity is minute (i.e Jobs can be scheduled to be executed
                         every minute)
                     2) Cron job can be scheduled by any normal user ( if not restricted by super
                          user )
                     3) Cron expects system to be running 24 x 7. If a job is scheduled, and
                         system is down during that time, job is not executed
                     4) Ideal for servers
                     5) Use cron when a job has to be executed at a particular hour and minute

      Anacron :
                     1) Minimum granularity is only in days
                     2) Anacron can be used only by super user ( but there are workarounds to
                         make it usable by normal user )
                     3) Anacron doesnâ€™t expect system to be running 24 x 7. If a job is scheduled,
                         and system is down during that time, it start the jobs when the system
                         comes back up.
                     4) Ideal for desktops and laptops
                     5) Use anacron when a job has to be executed irrespective of hour and
                          minute

30)  Default Port numbers used by ssh,ftp,http,https,telnet,smtp,pop3,pop3s,imap,imaps

Ans SSH 22, ftp 20/21, http 80, https 443, SMTP/SMPTS 25/465, POP3/POP3S 110/995, IMAP/IMAPS 143/993

31)  How to setup ACLs in following case:
         1) Create a file FILE1 and this should be read,write,executable for all user but Read only  for user USER1
        2) Copy FILE1 ACLs to FILE2 ACL
        3) Delete a USER1's rule for FILE1 which were setup in step 1)

Ans 1) touch FILE1 ; chmod 777 FILE1 ; setfacl -m u:USER1:r FILE1
        2) getfacl FILE1 | setfacl --set-file=- FILE2
        3) setfacl -x u:USER1 FILE1

Ans Try following to check:

        Enable/Disable SMART on device/disk : smartctl -s on /dev/sda
        Check device SMART health : smartctl -H /dev/sda
        Check device SMART capabilities : smartctl -c /dev/sda
        Enable/Disable automatic offline testing on device : smartctl -o on/off /dev/sda
        Show device SMART vendor-specific Attributes and values : smartctl -A /dev/sda
        Show device log [TYPE : error, selftest, selective, directory,background, 
                                     scttemp[sts,hist]] : smartctl -l TYPE /dev/sda
        Run test on device [TEST: offline short long conveyance select,M-N pending,N 
                                     afterselect,[on|off] scttempint,N[,p] : smartctl -t /dev/sda

34)  What is the difference between ext2 vs ext3 vs ext4?

Ans http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/05/ext2-ext3-ext4/

35)  Disable ping to avoid network/ICMP flood

Ans Set following in /etc/sysctl.conf : net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all = 1

      Then "sysctl -p"
  
      or 
   
   echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all

36)  What is SYN Flood, ICMP Flood

Ans SYN Flood : A SYN flood occurs when a host sends a flood of TCP/SYN packets, often with a 
          fake/forged sender address. Each of these packets is handled like a connection request, causing the 
          server to spawn a half-open connection, by sending back a TCP/SYN-ACK packet(Acknowledge), and 
          waiting for a packet in response from the sender address(response to the ACK Packet). However, 
          because the sender address is forged, the response never comes. These half-open connections 
          saturate the number of available connections the server is able to make, keeping it from responding to 
          legitimate requests until after the attack ends

      ICMP Flood : There are three types of ICMP Flood :
    
       1) Smurf Attack : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smurf_attack
       2) Ping Flood :  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_flood
       3) Ping of Death : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_of_death

37)  What is the difference between Unix vs Linux Kernels?

Ans Please find below given link :

        http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/01/linux-unix-kernel/

38) How to setup Password less remote login/ssh?

Ans Use "ssh-keygen -t dsa or rsa" at local system for creating public and private keys

        Then copy /root/.ssh/id_dsa.pub to remote_server by name /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
        Change permissions of /root/.ssh/authorized_keys file at remote_server "chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

        Now try to login from local system to remote_server "ssh root@remote_server"

39) Command to see default kernel image file

Ans "grubby --default-kernel"

40) How to create lvm mirror

41) Command to check last runlevel

Ans who -r

42) What do you mean by File System?

Ans File System is a method to store and organize files and directories on disk. A file system can have different formats called file system types. These formats determine how the information is stored as files and directories.

43) What is the requirement of udev daemon?

Ans Create and remove device nodes or files in /dev/ directory

44) What are block and character devices?

Ans Both the devices are present in /dev directory

Block device files talks to devices block by block [1 block at a time (1 block = 512 bytes to 32KB)].
Examples: - USB disk, CDROM, Hard Disk (sda, sdb, sdc etc....)

Character device files talk to devices character by character.
Examples: - Virtual terminals, terminals, serial modems, random numbers (tty{0,1,2,3......})

45) How to Convert ext2 to ext3 File System?

Ans tune2fs -j /dev/{device-name}

46) File required to modify for setting up kernel parameters permanent

Ans /etc/sysctl.conf

47) Commands used to install, list and remove modules from kernel 

Ans Installing/adding a module: 
                                                    insmod mod_name
                                                    modprobe mod_name

        List installed modules :  lsmod
        Removing a module     : modprobe -r mod_name

48) How to create swap using a file and delete swap

Ans Adding swap :

dd if=/dev/zero of=/opt/myswap bs=1024 count=4

mkswap /opt/myswap

swapon -a

For adding this myswap at boot time, add following in /etc/fstab file:

/opt/myswap       swap     swap   defaults   0 0


Deleting Swap :

Run "swapoff /opt/myswap" command
Remove the entry from /etc/fstab file
Remove /opt/myswap file (using rm command)

49) What vmstat show

Ans vmstat (virtual memory statistics) is a computer system monitoring tool that collects and displays summary information about operating system memory, processes, interrupts, paging and block I/O
50) What is tmpfs File System

Ans Reference : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmpfs

tmpfs is a common name for a temporary file storage facility on many Unix-like operating systems. It is intended to appear as a mounted file system, but stored in volatile memory instead of a persistent storage device. A similar construction is a RAM disk, which appears as a virtual disk drive and hosts a disk file system.

Everything stored in tmpfs is temporary in the sense that no files will be created on the hard drive; however, swap space is used as backing store in case of low memory situations. On reboot, everything in tmpfs will be lost.
The memory used by tmpfs grows and shrinks to accommodate the files it contains and can be swapped out to swap space.

51) What is the difference between screen and script commands?
Ans Screen is an screen manager with VT100/ANSI terminal emulation and used to take GNU screen session remotely or locally and while Script make typescript of terminal session

Screen : needs to be detached, should not be exited to access remotely/locally
Script : creates a file and store all the terminal output to this file

52) How can we check which process is assigned to which processor?

Ans Run "ps -elFL" and find out the PSR column which is showing the processor number to the process

53) How can we check vendor, version, release date, size, package information etc... of any installed rpm?

Ans) rpm -qi package-name , for example:

         rpm -qi ypbind-1.19-12.el5
